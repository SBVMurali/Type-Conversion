    "#Explain the significance of Python keywords and provide examples of five keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python keywords are reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the Python language. They are essential for defining the syntax and structure of your code. These keywords cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: Keywords provide the foundation for building Python programs. They define the control flow, loops, conditional statements, and other fundamental programming constructs.\n",
    "Clarity: By using keywords consistently, Python code becomes more readable and maintainable. It helps other programmers understand your code's logic easily.\n",
    "Consistency: Keywords enforce a uniform syntax, making Python code less prone to errors and easier to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "if: Used to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "for: Used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, or string).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",

    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",

    "Describe the rules for defining identifiers in Python and provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "An identifier in Python is a name given to a variable, function, class, module, or any other object. Here are the rules for defining valid identifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Must start with a letter or underscore: The first character of an identifier must be either an alphabet (uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore (_).\n",
    "Can contain letters, digits, and underscores: Subsequent characters can be letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.\n",
    "Case-sensitive: Python is case-sensitive, so myVariable and myvariable are considered different identifiers.\n",
    "Cannot be a keyword: Reserved keywords like if, for, while, class, etc., cannot be used as identifiers.\n",
    "No special characters: Special characters like !, @, #, $, %, etc., are not allowed in identifiers."

    "What are comments in Python, and why are they useful? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, comments are lines of text that are ignored by the interpreter during code execution. They are used to add explanatory notes or documentation within the code itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-line Comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin with a hash symbol (#)\n",

    "Enclosed within triple quotes (either single (''') or double (\"\"\"))\n",
    "Can span multiple lines.\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "This is a multi-line comment. \n",
    "It can extend over multiple lines.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Why are Comments Useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability: Comments make code easier to understand by providing explanations, clarifying the purpose of code blocks, and documenting design decisions.\n",
    "Maintainability: When revisiting or modifying code, comments help you and others understand the logic and intent behind the code.\n",
    "Debugging: Comments can help pinpoint the cause of errors by providing context and explanations of specific parts of the code.\n",
    "Collaboration: Comments facilitate collaboration among developers by making it easier for others to understand and contribute to the codebase.\n",

    "Why is proper indentation important in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, indentation is more than just a stylistic choice; it's a fundamental part of the language's syntax. Unlike many other programming languages that use curly braces {} to define code blocks, Python relies on consistent indentation to determine the scope and structure of your code.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it so important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining Code Blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation groups statements together to form code blocks.   \n",
    "For example, in if, else, for, while, def, and class statements, the indented lines belong to that specific block.\n",
    "Enforcing Readability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistent indentation makes your code visually appealing and easier to follow.   \n",
    "It highlights the logical flow and hierarchy of your program.   \n",
    "Preventing Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorrect indentation can lead to IndentationError exceptions, which can be frustrating to debug.\n",
    "Python strictly enforces indentation rules, so even a single misplaced space can cause your code to malfunction.   \n"

    "\n",
    "Code within a block (e.g., if, else, for, while, def, class) is not indented at all.\n",
    "Python expects indented code within these blocks, so it raises an IndentationError.\n",
    "Inconsistent Indentation:\n",

    "Different levels of indentation are used within the same block.\n",
    "Python requires consistent indentation within a block for proper code execution.\n",
    "Mixing Tabs and Spaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using both tabs and spaces for indentation can lead to unexpected results.\n",
    "It's best to use only spaces (preferably 4 spaces per level) for consistent indentation.\n",

    "Consequences of IndentationErrors:\n",

    "Code Failure: The program will not run as intended due to the incorrect code structure.\n",
